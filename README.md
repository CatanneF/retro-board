# Retro Board
### Created by Catherine Felton

This is a retrospective board inspired by those used in Scrum workflows.  
## Features:
+ An option to rename the board where the "Utitled Board" placeholder is found
+ Three task columns:  Went Well, To Imporove, and Action Items
+ An Add New button (+) after the column names to add a new task box
+ Task boxes that allow the user to type content directly inside 
+ Task boxes also have a delete button as well as left and right arrows that allow the user to move task boxes to another column.
+ Layout Options can be found in the navbar to switch the layout of the Task Board between vertical and horizontal
